# 前言

这次C题都卡点做出来，但是因为CF显示的时间不对，结果我还没提交就已经结束了

## [C. Basic Diplomacy](https://codeforces.com/contest/1484/problem/C)

Aleksey has n friends. He is also on a vacation right now, so he has m days to play this new viral cooperative game! But since it's cooperative, Aleksey will need one teammate in each of these m days.

On each of these days some friends will be available for playing, and all others will not. On each day Aleksey must choose one of his available friends to offer him playing the game (and they, of course, always agree). However, if any of them happens to be chosen strictly more than ⌈m2⌉ times, then all other friends are offended. Of course, Aleksey doesn't want to offend anyone.

Help him to choose teammates so that nobody is chosen strictly more than ⌈m2⌉ times.

中文大意：Aleksey有n个朋友，他需要在m天内有人陪他玩，但是每天只有一些人能够配玩，而且每个人陪他玩的天数不能超过m/2（向上取整）

解析：有且仅有来的最多的那位朋友来的天数$>(m+1/2)$，且唯一的天数$>(m+1/2)$的时候不行。记录每天来的人，可行的话，先把每天只来一个人的情况选了，后面再选择天数$<=(m+1/2)$的人

```cpp
// 有且仅有来的最多的那位朋友来的天数>向上取整m/2且唯一天数大于>向上取整m/2不行
// vector数组记录每个人来的天数和唯一的那天就可以判断了
// 那每天的人怎么办？？？
// 记录每天来的人，即可
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define IO ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0)
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1e5 + 5;
vector<int> a[MAXN];
struct Friend {
  vector<int> days;
  int select;
} friends[MAXN];        // 每个人来的天数
vector<int> day[MAXN];  // 每天来什么人
int selects[MAXN];
int main() {
  // IO;
  int cas;
  cin >> cas;
  while (cas--) {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      friends[i].days.clear();
      friends[i].select = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      day[i].clear();
    }
    memset(selects, 0, sizeof(selects));
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      int k, temp;
      cin >> k;
      for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
        cin >> temp;
        friends[temp].days.push_back(i);
        day[i].push_back(temp);
      }
      if (k == 1) {
        friends[temp].days.pop_back();
        friends[temp].select++;
        selects[i] = temp;
      }
    }
    bool flag = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (friends[i].select > (m + 1) / 2) {
        flag = false;
      }
    }
    if (flag) {
      cout << "YES" << endl;
      for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        if (!selects[i]) {
          for (int j = 0; j < day[i].size(); j++) {
            if (friends[day[i][j]].select < (m + 1) / 2) {
              selects[i] = day[i][j];
              friends[day[i][j]].select++;
              break;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cout << selects[i] << " ";
      }
      cout << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

## [D. Playlist](https://codeforces.com/contest/1484/problem/D)

Arkady has a playlist that initially consists of n songs, numerated from 1 to n in the order they appear in the playlist. Arkady starts listening to the songs in the playlist one by one, starting from song 1. The playlist is cycled, i. e. after listening to the last song, Arkady will continue listening from the beginning.

Each song has a genre ai, which is a positive integer. Let Arkady finish listening to a song with genre y, and the genre of the next-to-last listened song be x. If gcd(x,y)=1, he deletes the last listened song (with genre y) from the playlist. After that he continues listening normally, skipping the deleted songs, and forgetting about songs he listened to before. In other words, after he deletes a song, he can't delete the next song immediately.

Here gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.

For example, if the initial songs' genres were [5,9,2,10,15], then the playlist is converted as follows: [5, 9, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 9, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 2, 10, 15] (because gcd(5,9)=1) → [5, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 2, 10, 15] → [5, 10, 15] (because gcd(5,2)=1) → [5, 10, 15] → [5, 10, 15] → ... The bold numbers represent the two last played songs. Note that after a song is deleted, Arkady forgets that he listened to that and the previous songs.

Given the initial playlist, please determine which songs are eventually deleted and the order these songs are deleted.

中文大意：若后一首歌与前一首歌的最大公约数为1，则删除后一首歌，问会删除多少首歌，和删除的顺序

解析：蹲一手官方题解（就如没有就算了）

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define IO ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0)
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1e5 + 5;
int a[MAXN], nxt[MAXN], res[MAXN];  // nxt下一首歌  res删除的歌
bool deleted[MAXN];                 // 是否被删除了
int main() {
  // IO;
  int cas;
  cin >> cas;
  while (cas--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    deque<int> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
      nxt[i] = i + 1;
      deleted[i] = false;
      q.push_back(i);
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    nxt[n] = 1;
    // if(gcd(a, b) != 1) 则a永远不可能被删除
    while (!q.empty()) {
      int x = q.front();
      q.pop_front();
      if (deleted[x]) continue;
      if (__gcd(a[x], a[nxt[x]]) == 1) {
        res[++cnt] = nxt[x];
        deleted[nxt[x]] = true;
        nxt[x] = nxt[nxt[x]];
        q.push_back(x);
      }
    }
    cout << cnt << " ";
    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) {
      cout << res[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
